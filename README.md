# Web Scraping IMDB and Spring CRUD
This project is a comprehensive example of combining web scraping, data handling, and API integration with a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Spring Boot Application. It demonstrates how to scrape data from websites using Selenium, store that data in JSON format, and then use the data to interact with a REST API built using Spring Boot.

The project can be broken down into three major components:

1. Web Scraping with Selenium: Automating the extraction of data from websites, Why using selenium? when using beautiful soup I got limit to just 25 movies.
2. Data Storage in JSON: Storing the scraped data in a structured JSON format.
3. CRUD API with Spring Boot: Building a Spring Boot REST API to handle CRUD operations with the scraped data.
4. Client-Side Posting: Using a Python client to POST the JSON data to the API.
